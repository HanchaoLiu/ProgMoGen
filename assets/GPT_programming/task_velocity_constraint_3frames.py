# PROMPT:
# Hi, I'd like to give you a task description and you are required to write python code for me. Specifically, the input argument is "Motion", it is a list of dictionaries where the index represents the frame and each dictionary stores the 3D coordinates of all human body joints. I will also give you a task description containing constraints of human motions. Then you need to write python code to compute the total error of the input human motion following my given constraints. The function you can use is as below: "DistToPoint", "DistToLine", "DistToPlane", which compute the distance between a point to the other point, a line, and a plane respectively, and "max(margin-Motion, 0)", "max(Motion-margin,0)", which provide the inequality constraints for motion, and "getVelocity(joint)", "getDirection(joint1, joint2)", "getKeyframe(Motion, t)". Do you understand the rule?
# Task: a person is walking with velocity specified at first, middle and last frames. The velocity for the three frames are represented as v0, v1 and v2, respectively.

import math

# Sample functions to compute distance between a point, line, and plane
def DistToPoint(point1, point2):
    return math.sqrt(sum((p1 - p2) ** 2 for p1, p2 in zip(point1, point2)))

def DistToLine(point, line_point1, line_point2):
    # Implement your distance calculation logic here
    pass

def DistToPlane(point, plane_point, plane_normal):
    # Implement your distance calculation logic here
    pass

# Sample function to apply inequality constraint max(margin - Motion, 0)
def max_margin_constraint_below(value, margin):
    return max(margin - value, 0)

# Sample function to apply inequality constraint max(Motion - margin, 0)
def max_margin_constraint_above(value, margin):
    return max(value - margin, 0)

# Sample function to get joint velocity
def getVelocity(joint):
    # Implement your logic to get joint velocity
    pass

# Sample function to get direction between two joints
def getDirection(joint1, joint2):
    # Implement your logic to get direction between joint1 and joint2
    pass

# Sample function to get keyframe from Motion at time t
def getKeyframe(Motion, t):
    return Motion[t]

def compute_total_error(Motion, v0, v1, v2):
    total_error = 0

    # Assuming Motion is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing 3D coordinates of body joints
    for frame, joints in enumerate(Motion):
        # Extract the coordinates of the relevant joints
        # For example, you may have "left_foot", "right_foot", etc.
        # Adjust these based on your actual data structure
        position = joints.get("position", None)

        if position is not None:
            # Calculate distance to specified velocities at first, middle, and last frames
            if frame == 0:
                total_error += DistToPoint(getVelocity(position), v0)
            elif frame == len(Motion) // 2:
                total_error += DistToPoint(getVelocity(position), v1)
            elif frame == len(Motion) - 1:
                total_error += DistToPoint(getVelocity(position), v2)

            # Apply additional constraints if needed
            # For example, you can add constraints on motion, velocity, etc.

    return total_error

# Example usage
Motion = [
    {"position": (1, 2, 3)},
    {"position": (4, 5, 6)},
    {"position": (7, 8, 9)},
    # Add more frames as needed
]

v0 = (1, 0, 0)  # Velocity at first frame
v1 = (0, 1, 0)  # Velocity at middle frame
v2 = (-1, 0, 0)  # Velocity at last frame

total_error = compute_total_error(Motion, v0, v1, v2)
print("Total error for specified velocities:", total_error)
